Preface
=======

Welcome to the documentation for *ErbslandFORMER*. This guide will help you understand and utilize the application effectively.

For a basic overview of the application, start with the :ref:`quick-start` chapter. If you are ready to begin setting up the application, you can proceed directly to the :ref:`installation` section.

Key Features
============

- Project, document, and document fragment-based text organization.
- Automatic splitting into appropriately sized fragments for various tasks, based on units like LLM tokens, characters, words, lines, or bytes.
- Special split point handling for formats such as Markdown, C/C++, Python, and plain text.
- Simple revision system for incremental project transformation.
- Integrated LLM processor using OpenAI's API, supporting models like GPT-4o, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- Integrated regular expression processor for pattern-based document transformation.
- Import and export capabilities for single documents or ZIP files with folder structures.
- Integrated user management, with a superuser, admin users and regular users.

Requirements
============

This application consists of a frontend, a Django/WSGI application, a database, and a backend that executes tasks in separate threads. The following are required:

- **Python 3.12+**

  The application is written for Python 3.12 or newer and requires the packages listed in `requirements.txt` or `requirements.in`. While the listed versions are tested, you may update them to the latest versions if needed.

- **Apache or nginx: Webserver to run a WSGI application**

  A web server or proxy, like Apache or nginx, is required to run the frontend application. Refer to the documentation for setting up your chosen web service for a WSGI application. For testing purposes, you can use Django's built-in web server.

- **Redis: Message Broker for Celery and the Frontend**

  Redis is necessary as a message broker for Celery to handle background tasks that may take extensive time to complete. Redis also facilitates communication between running tasks and the web interface to display progress and logs.

- **MariaDB/MySQL/Postgres Database**

  A database like MySQL, MariaDB, or Postgres is needed to store all processed data. For handling large amounts of data, ensure your database installation is appropriately scaled. You may also consider moving the text content table to a specialized database for better performance.
