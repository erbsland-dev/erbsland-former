    The processor part of a transformer.

    A new instance of the processor is created for each transformation. This instance is used to process the
    selected content of a project. Each document fragment is fed into the `transform` method in the
    *ordered sequence* as they are selected by the user.

    For this reason, it is safe if you like to keep a history of processed data, e.g. to make sure the
    transition between two fragments is transformed correctly. You can also use `context` to access previous
    processed fragments, or the previous or next fragments in the current processed document.

    The transformation is run in a separate process and can block processing for a long time. Yet, you should
    check the method `is_stop_requested` in regular intervals to make sure the transformation can be stopped
    on user request.
